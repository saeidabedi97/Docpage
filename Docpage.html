        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Shiraz is founded in Pars Province, a central area for Persian civilisation.</p> 
            <p>The earliest reference to Shiraz is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BC, 
            found in June 1970 during digging for the construction of a brick kiln in the southwest corner of the city.
            The tablets, written in ancient Elamite, name a city called Tiraziš.</p>
            <p>Phonetically, this is interpreted as /tiračis/ or /ćiračis/. This name became Old Persian /širājiš/; 
            through regular sound change comes the modern Persian name Shirāz.</p>

        <h4>Economy</h4>
        <p>Shiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. 
        The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz.
        The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods,
        either directly from Europe or via India.</p>
